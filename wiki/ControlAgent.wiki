#summary How to work with the ControlAgent
#labels Phase-Implementation

==Introduction==

The !ControlAgent implements NeuroServer's Controller role. As it has no functions in NeuroServer it has none in !JavaNeuroClient. 

==Details==

The !ControlAgent extends the DefaultAgent which has some basic commands:
 * `hello()`
 * `getRole()`
 * `getStatus()`
 * `close()`

You can create a !ControlAgent the same as EEGAgent and !DisplayAgent; with an hostname and port (both optional).

// create a new ControlAgent
ControlAgent agent = new ControlAgent("localhost", 8336);
