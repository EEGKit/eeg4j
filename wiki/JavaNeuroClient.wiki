#summary How to send raw commands with JavaNeuroClient to NeuroSever
#labels Phase-Implementation

==Introduction==

!JavaNeuroClient provides a basic way to communicate with NeuroServer. It is possible to send raw commands over TCP/IP to NeuroServer and receive responses by implementing the NeuroServerInputListener.

==Details==

To send raw commands to NeuroServer first you need to create a NeuroServerConnection, connect to NeuroServer and send commands.
{{{
// create a new NeuroServerConnection
NeuroServerConnection connection = new NeuroServerConnection("localhost", 8336);

// connect to NeuroServer
connection.connect();

// send hello command
connection.sendCommand(Command.HELLO);

// disconnect from NeuroServer
connection.disconnect();
}}}

You should check if there is a connection with NeuroServer before sending a command.
{{{
// check if connection is connected
if(connection.isConnected()) {
    // send hello command
    connection.sendCommand(Command.HELLO);			
}
}}}

By implementing the NeuroServerInputListener and register as listener, you will receive updates when NeuroClient received input from NeuroServer.
{{{
// register as listener
connection.addListener(this);
}}}

{{{
public void receivedLine(String line) {
    // output incoming lines from NeuroServer
    System.out.println(line);
}
}}}

!JavaNeuroClient also contains implementations of the three different NeuroServer roles. For this, see the wiki on DisplayAgent, [EEGAgent] or ControlAgent.
